## Description

In this app you are able to look through a list of movies of movies and when you click on one of them it will take you to a sepreate details page that will have the title, poster, genres, and description on the movie that ypu choose. The details page also has a home button that will bring you back to the home page. The trickist part of is project was connecting the movie that you chose and the genres corresponding with the movie choosen since the genres and movie details were in two different tables and each movie could have muiltiple genres so I had to use a many to many sql join in my server routes to the database. I was also tough finding a way to connect the information on the client side, I use .filter to go that and .map to put them together.
